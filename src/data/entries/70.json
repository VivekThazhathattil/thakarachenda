        "!PRE_3 guys are hiking through the woods when they find a lamp. One of them picks it up, rubs it, and out pops a Genie._It booms 'You have finally freed me after all these years, so I'll grant each one of you 3 wishes.' The first guy immediately blurts out 'I want a billion dollars.' POOF, he's holding a printout that shows his account balance is now in fact 1,000,000,003.50_The second man thinks for a bit, then says 'I want to be the richest man alive.' POOF, he's holding papers showing his net worth is now well over 100 billion._The third guy thinks even longer about his wish, then says 'I want my left arm to rotate clockwise for the rest of my life.' POOF, his arm starts rotating._The Genie tells them it's time for their second wish._First guy says: 'I want to be married to the most beautiful woman on earth.' POOF, a stunning beauty wraps herself around his arm._Second guy says 'I want to be good-looking and charismatic, so I can have every girl I want.' POOF, his looks change and the first guy's wife immediately starts flirting with him._Third guy says 'I want my right arm to rotate counter-clockwise until I die.' POOF, now both his arms are rotating, in opposite directions._The genie tells them to think very carefully about their third wish._First guy does, and after a while says 'I never want to become sick or injured, I want to stay healthy until I die.' POOF, his complexion improves, his acne is gone and his knees don't bother him any more._Second guy says 'I never want to grow old. I want to stay 29 forever.' POOF, he looks younger already._Third guy smiles triumphantly and says 'My last wish is for my head to nod back and forth.' POOF, he's now nodding his head and still flailing his arms around._The genie wishes them good luck, disappears, and the men soon go their separate ways.__Many years later they meet again and chat about how things have been going. First guy is ecstatic: 'I've invested the money and multiplied it many times over, so me and my family will be among the richest of the rich pretty much forever. My wife is a freak in the sheets, and I've never gotten so much as a cold in all these years.' Second guy smiles and says 'Well, I built charities worldwide with a fraction of my wealth, I'm still the richest guy alive and also revered for my good deeds. I haven't aged a day since we last met, and yes, your wife is pretty wild in bed.'_Third guy walks in, flailing his arms around and nodding his head, and says:__'Guys, I think I fucked up.'",
        "!PRE_Two friends were hiking and came upon a big hole in the ground. One guy picks up a rock and tosses it into the hole and stands listening for the rock to hit bottom. Slam!__He turns to the other guy and says 'That must be a deep hole... let's throw a bigger rock in there and listen for it to hit bottom.' The men find a bigger rock and both pick it up and drags it to the hole and drop it in. They listened for some time and.... Slam!__Again, they agree that this must be one deep hole and maybe they should throw something even bigger into it. One man spots a big log nearby. They pick it up, grunting and groaning, and throw it to the hole, listening intently...... Slam! All of a sudden, a goat comes out of the woods, running like the wind, and flies past the men and jumps straight into the hole. The friends are astounded.__Tired of their hike, they walk back through the woods, and a little later meet an old farmer who asks the men if they had seen a goat. One man tells the farmer of the incredible incident they had just witnessed of the goat running out of the woods, and run and leap into the big hole. He asks the farmer if this could've been his goat.__The old farmer says 'Naw, that can't be my goat, it was tied to a big log.'",
