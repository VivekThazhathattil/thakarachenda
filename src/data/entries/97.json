        "!PRE_What is life but a grim stained glass,_wipe and wipe, me a man with no class,_Moment you think the dust settled at last,_think again, says the punk, alas!_Tried to tie a knot, ain't that a big chore?_Sinking anchor, ship's off the shore_Won't let me have a stage to play, never!_my puppet dance, that awful mist - lingers forever,_ain't no flukes, just stop signs in my face,_Silence it is, yet another mind race to disgrace,_mind against mind, is it chess? It better be._Nameless disease, or a trench for the hopeless?_Gotta pick myself up, only not right now._I'm another man, not a cart for your dream,_neither a dumpster to blow off your steam._I left you when that stranger cut the cord,_no fancy leash can ever replace that cord."
