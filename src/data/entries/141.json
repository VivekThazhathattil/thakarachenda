        "!PRE_Probably a mango tree,_Young and weak_For a while pushing off_a bunch of noisy colleagues_Half the light, _half the breeze,_Half the soil,_Half the birds.__Mighty lame origin story:_Dropped from the hands_Of a monkey too bored._Half eaten, drenched_In monkey spit__Bed full of dead leaves,_Parade of ants,_Parade of ants again_Parade of ants yet again._Quite a few curious noses_But never invested_In this thing, a deity in dirt_Blessings to ones who bow.__Still sad to fall prey_To the long tailed dimwit._Red and ripe, never could._Away from the moisty grave_Quite a few green leaves too__Many days kissed_The feet of giants_Always a puppet_For the stormy nights__Storms love trees_Not too gentle,_their lullabies_For age old trees_Shake the woods_Sail to sleep_Hug the dirt_One final time,_All at once."
